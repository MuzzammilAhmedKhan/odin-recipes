    <h2>Indian curry - Khorma</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Originated in Persia, brought to India during Akbar period, and modified
      in Kashmir. The recipe varies from region to region and restaurant to
      restaurant. North Indian Korma is pale yellow in color from saffron and
      cooked without any tomatoes or turmeric. This recipe version will be the
      closest to the traditional Kashmiri Korma. Kashmir Pandits substitute
      onion and garlic with asafoetida. Serve with jasmine rice and mango
      chutney.
